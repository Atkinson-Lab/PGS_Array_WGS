# Array-PGS vs. WGS-PGS 
### Here are the directories and file used for the PGS analyses in the paper:

- `All_of_Us`: Contains the main scripts used for PGS computation on the *All of Us* platform. All individaul-level information has been removed. 

- `PRS-CS`: Contains scripts for running PRS-CS on a local machine. The outpus were uploaded back onto the *All of Us* platform to compute PGS.

- `ldblk`: Contains codes for generating the whole-genome LD matrix in 1kGP + HGDP EUR.

- `LDSC`: Contains codes for calculating heritability for the 10 Pan-UKBB tratis.

- `phenotype_list.txt`: Lists 10 Pan-UKBB GWAS traits and their sample sizes that were used in PRS-CS and LDSC.
